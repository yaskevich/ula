# ula

_ula_ is Proto-Slavic for 'street, passway' 

This is a tool for exploratory analysis of street names.

Currently, it's customized for two Polish datasets:
- the streets. It's a list of names with the relation to adminstrative division. It's published in [TERYT Registry](https://eteryt.stat.gov.pl/eTeryt/) maintained by the government agency [Statistics Poland](https://stat.gov.pl/).
- the regions (voivodeships). It's geospatial data from [this repo](https://github.com/radoslaw-sz/polska-geojson/).
